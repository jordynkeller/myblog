#Assignment Instructions! 

Follow along with chapter 3 on creating the Cat Blog. The template is found here: https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog/

Other images and assets for this project are in the textbook, but please make changes to this. Don't turn in an exact replica of what's in the book. Make it your own!

Whatever you do, remember that this chapter (and unit) was on making a blog with a static site generator. Thus, your assignment must have a blog in it.

Submit the URL of your site and a simple paragraph describing your experiences with Jekyll. How does it compare to Harp?
